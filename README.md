# data-science-notes
A labelled index of data science articles and research papers for future self-reference

### About
A repository inspired from [machine-learning-articles](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/machine-learning-articles) for notes management of articles and research papers using the 'Issues' feature within any normal GitHub repository.

### Motivation
1. Assisting the memory when it's finally time to deliver! Most times it's days of just lots of reading, reading, reading which would essentially be the input. Driving the desired output at the end of it would require significant memorization, hence this serves as a quick index for potentially useful articles and papers within Data Science.
2. Using the wonderful 'labels', a natural feature around GitHub issues, this repo would serve for a quick lookup using keywords along topics or processes that are marked as TODO items for future projects.
